# Web App Description
This app was designed as a way for people to be able to de-stress by themselves. Sometimes, we just don't want to tell anyone that we're sad yah know.

We decided to include 8 features
  + Schedule
     - App remids you to do the little things because they matter. Also allows you to list any accomplishments you've done for        the day
  + RANT
    - Has a voice recording feature for when you want to rant or vent but you don't particularly want to talk to anyone. And          after you record your voice, the system will give you the opportunity to reflect upon your rant. For example, it asks          you if the vent or rant came from another person, what would you tell them?
  + Message Future
    - Allows you to send a message to your future self to let you know know that you ARE moving forward and that you've             accomplished a lot
  + Smile
